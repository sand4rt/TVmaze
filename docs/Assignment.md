**Requirements**

You will use an open TV shows API <http://www.tvmaze.com/api> to create an application that allows users to view a few lists(preferable horizontal list) of TV shows based on different genres (drama, comedy, sports, etc.).

Your goal is to display a few popular TV shows based on their rating and genre on a dashboard and when the user clicks on a TV show then the details of that TV show should be displayed on another screen.

Also, the user should be able to search for a TV show to get the details. You can design your own UI which fits this requirement.

**Architecture**

There is no limit for this. Design your application as you wish. But make sure you will focus on clean code, reusability, frontend best practices. Show us that you know how to produce top notch applications.
